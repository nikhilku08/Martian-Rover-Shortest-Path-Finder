# Martian-Rover-Shortest-Path-Finder

The following list gives the objectives of this project:
● To determine and identify the concepts of the shortest path problem.
● To determine the representation of graphs in a computer in order to solve the
shortest path problem, as well as to understand the different basic terms of a
graph.
● To explain the general concepts and the implementations of Dijkstra’s
Algorithm, Breadth-First Search, and Floyd Warshall Algorithm.
● To evaluate each algorithm, and present the results of the evaluation.
● Use these various path-finding algorithms for assisting the Martian rover in
concluding the shortest path to the destination while traversing a specific area.
